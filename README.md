# Step to run the mac_address script

Step 1. Install python(V3.9).
step 2. Install requests library

          pip install request
        
Step 3. clone the python file.
  
   
Step 3. run the script( I ran this script on window os) by excuting below command:

      In output you will get Company name associate to mac_address.
